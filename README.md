Simple Youtube Video Embedder BBC
=================================
This mod parses & displays youtube videos automatically. This mod supports both 'youtube.com' & 'youtu.be' links and also http/https links. This mod also adds a 'youtube' BBC.

Since youtube video links are automatically parsed & displayed, there is no need to use the 'youtube' tags. At the same time, youtube links & video id's wrapped within 'youtube' tags also work.

In addition to these features, this mod supports the following format also which was used by some old mods.
